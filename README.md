# Python Calculator
# Overview
Hello! I'm Mert, and welcome to Day 10 of my "100 Days of Python" challenge. Today, I'm excited to introduce my Python Calculator. This interactive Python script performs basic arithmetic operations, allowing users to continuously calculate without restarting the program.

## How It Works
The Python Calculator offers a simple and user-friendly interface:

* Start Calculating: The program first prompts you to enter a number.
* Choose Operation: Select an arithmetic operation (+, -, *, /) for the calculation.
* Enter Next Number: Input the next number for the operation.
* View Result: The program calculates and displays the result.
* Continuous Calculation: You can choose to continue calculating with the result or start a new calculation.
* Restart or Exit: Decide whether to perform a new calculation or exit the program.
# Features
* Basic Operations: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
* Continuous Calculations: Allows calculations to build upon the previous result.
* Clear and Concise Interface: Easy-to-follow prompts guide you through each step.
* User Input Validation: Ensures that only valid numbers and operations are entered.
* Clean Console: Clears the screen for each new calculation for better readability.

## Required Libraries and Files
To run this program, the following is required:

* replit: A library used for clearing the console screen, which helps maintain a clean interface for each new bidder.
> pip install replit 
* art.py: This file is included in the repository. It provides ASCII art, such as logos, to enhance the user interface and the program's visual appeal.
## User Guide
To use the Python Calculator, simply run the script and follow the on-screen instructions. Input your numbers and choose the desired operation. After each calculation, decide whether to continue with the result or start fresh.

## Conclusion    
This Python Calculator is perfect for quick arithmetic tasks. It combines basic programming concepts with a practical application, making it an ideal project for Python beginners. Enjoy the simplicity and functionality of your very own Python-powered calculator!
